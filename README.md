## Motivation

From manufacturing to automotive to agriculture, industrial robotic arms are one of the most common types of robots in use today.<br>
Robotic arms are fast, reliable, and accurate and can be programmed to do an infinite number of tasks in a variety of environments. They are used in factories to automate execution of repetitive tasks, such as applying paint to equipment or parts; in warehouses to pick, select, or sort goods from distribution conveyors to fulfill consumer orders; or in a farm field to pick and place ripe fruits onto storage trays. And as robotic technologies develop and industrial environments become more connected, the capabilities of robotic arms expand to enable new use cases and business operation models.

## Mechanical Aspects 

3-D model of robotic arm was made in Solidworks part by part.

## Software Aspects

### SolidWorks

SOLIDWORKS is used to develop mechatronics systems from beginning to end. At the initial stage, the software is used for planning, visual ideation, modeling, feasibility assessment, prototyping, and project management. The software is then used for design and building of mechanical, electrical, and software elements.

### ROS (Robot Operating System)

ROS is an open-source, meta-operating system for your robot. It provides the services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

### MoveIt!

MoveIt! is a framework package of Ros. The basic task of the MoveIt! system is to provide the necessary trajectories for the arm of a robot to put the end effector in a given place.
