## Motivation

From manufacturing to automotive to agriculture, industrial robotic arms are one of the most common types of robots in use today.<br>
Robotic arms are fast, reliable, and accurate and can be programmed to do an infinite number of tasks in a variety of environments. They are used in factories to automate execution of repetitive tasks, such as applying paint to equipment or parts; in warehouses to pick, select, or sort goods from distribution conveyors to fulfill consumer orders; or in a farm field to pick and place ripe fruits onto storage trays. And as robotic technologies develop and industrial environments become more connected, the capabilities of robotic arms expand to enable new use cases and business operation models.

## Mechanical Aspects 

3-D model of robotic arm was made in Solidworks part by part.
